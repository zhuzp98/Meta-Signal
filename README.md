## Intro of Meta-Signal

### What is Meta-Signal
- Meta-Signal is a signal system for price actions in most of the markets. 

### Idea
- The indicators are wildly used in technical analysis and quantitative strategies. It is pretty common to use several indicators to get some alerts of price reversals as well as some potential pumpings. Hence we are thinking of a framework adapting several key indicators with a score system for alerts. 

### Release
- The most recent available version will be tested in TradingView with *<Version=5>* Pine Script. All the releases in Pine Script will have the features of alerts and on-chart figures. Some releases are strategies and you may get the backtest result from TradingView desktop apps. 
- Some versions will be translated to Python and running under BackTrader quantitative framework. These releases are not necessary to have full features and we may use these for training with machine learning techniques. 
- The reliable versions will be released in both TradingView community and GitHub. We will have separated repos for reliable releases. In TradingView platform, we will also provide some pre-tuned versions for invitation-only. Otherwise, you will get the customizable framework for free in both Pine and Python languages.
